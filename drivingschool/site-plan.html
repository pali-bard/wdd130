      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to build a website for my families driving school business. The goal of the school is to meet the state requirements for driver education in the state of Utah. We provide in class education as well as behind the wheel training. I want to create them a website that presents the information, allows the users to download forms for registration, and introduces them to the company. I’d like a page that presents information about the program, a page that introduces the staff and mission, and a page for announcements and a way to contact us.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is the prospective customers to The Driving School. The audience will typically consist of parents and grandparents who want to sign their kids or grandkids up for driver education. A few kids may also be looking into it for themselves also.</p>  <!-- change this -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
